<h1>Puppies</h1>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppies">Puppies</a> are cute they are happy and fluffy and there are 6.2 million puppies born in the U.S. every year! Like humans, puppies are born without teeth.However, they can't hear, see or smell! Puppies don't open their eyes or begin to hear until they're 9 to 12 days old. They can't smell until three weeks post birth. Until then, it's very important for the mini-puppies to stay close to mom and their siblings to eat and grow properly.</p>
